A once through regular HYSYS reboiler. 1100kPa for the reboiler, with a 10kPa drop through the reboiler, 1061 kPa for the condenser, with a 10kPa drop through the condenser, in accordance with the heuristic that a phase change in a heat exchanger should be done with a 10kPa drop. We used the condenser and reboiler temperature estimates from the shortcut column in the full column which were 68 and 183 degrees Celcius respectively. 0.8 reflux ratio because we found we needed a much higher value than expected and then a 99.5%. The bottoms flow rate ended up being to 2165 kgmol/hr. This resulted in a purity in the bottoms stream of $12-ClC_2$ of 98.89%. The majority of the balance was water. If our customers will be satisfied with this purity then we should require no other seperations. If our customers need less water in their product we would suggest either a pressure swing column or with the purity already high a dehydrated salt could be used to scavenge the water. TRiiSO produces such chemicals specifically targeted at polyurthane production, and presumably our product will be used to produce PVC so this might be a good fit.\n",
