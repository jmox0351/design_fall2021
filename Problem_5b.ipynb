    "We can see from our comparision table the minimum, actual, and feed trays are all quite similar across all columns. The reflux ratio for the hand calcs and the shortcut column were close but the full HYSYS column took a much higher ratio to converge. We ultimately went with 0.8 because it gave us some wiggle room with other parameters. Our actual reflux ratio again was close for the hand calc and shortcut column, but significantly higher for the full column. We think the reflux ratio is higher in the full column becuase of significant non-ideal liquid interaction between polar and non-polar molecules. The diameter was similar between the hand calculations and the full HYSYS column. We also note we had to change the diameter of the HYSYS column because it was initially too small. The biggest difference was between the hand calcs and the full column in HYSYS for height. We are not entirely sure why there is such a large discrepancy here, but one reason is because HYSYS may not be adding the additional space for bottoms storage and disengagement height at the top. The other is HYSYS may be trying to pack the column down as far as possible, which may be cost effective for building it, but makes maintence much more difficult. \n",

    "In our full HYSYS column we specified the reflux ratio and the recovery of 12-ClC2 in the bottoms. We had an idea about what the reflux ratio might be and the customer gave us the spec for the bottoms recovery. The reflux ratio was significantly higher than we expected, but once we had it converged the rest of the column was easy enough to design. \n",
    "\n",
    "This column seems feasible from a building standpoint. a column of 20 meters is tall, but not uncommon in the hydrocarbon industry. If the height is closer the full column in HYSYS then it is not  tall than a 2 story building, quite feasible indeed. The next steps for us would be an economics study. We have not looked at the energy consumption or the cost of running the column vs. profit. At this point we can say the column is buildable, but not if it make financial sense to build it. "
